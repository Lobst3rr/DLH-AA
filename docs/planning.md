# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Our project 'BMX HotSpot' is an app that uses open data from bristols opedata,gov site to locate BMX facilities. The reason we have chosen this is to help BMX riders locate a park where they can safely use their BMX without the risk of cars or pedestrians in the way. In 2022, 91 pedal cyclists were killed in Great Britain, whilst 4,056 were reported to be seriously injured and 11,546 slightly injured by using an app that will safely locate these facilities we aim to lower these deaths.

### Business benefits
The benefits this app will provide are as follows:
- Public safety
- Safe Routes for riders
- Unknown BMX Facility locations

### Options Considered
Some other customer options would be safe routes to get to these facilities by highliting bike paths that lead there as well as including traffic on roads so the customer can avoid taking busy roads that may lead to accidents. 

### Expected Risks
The main risks of this project are:
- There are already apps that locate these facilities
- Traffic can be unpredicatable
- Some facilities include other modes of sports there.
