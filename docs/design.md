## User Interface design

when it comes to wireframes we know them as a visual representation of what a website layout would look like. Looking at 
wireframes it is used to focus more on arrangements such as functionality rather than aesthetics and looks as if it is the 
blueprint for building, outlining the form and the relation between different parts of the website without the whole detailed 
graphic parts (CSS). Wireframes are crucial as they help identify potential issues that could occur early in the development process. 

BMX FINDER wireframe:
--
When constructing the wireframe we opted to use whimsical as it has an easy layout and it made it easier to group everything together making it easier to visually see how each page of the BMX finder website would be looking when made.
