## User Interface design

when it comes to wireframes we know them as a visual representation of what a website layout would look like. Looking at 
wireframes it is used to focus more on arrangements such as functionality rather than aesthetics and looks as it is the 
blueprint for building, outlining the form and the relation between different parts of the website without the whole detailed 
graphic parts (CSS). Wireframes are crucial as they help identify potential issues that could occur early in the development process. Discovering potential issues is highly important as it allows us to stay on track and get the website done on time 

BMX FINDER wireframe:
--
When constructing the wireframe we opted to use whimsical tool as it has an easy layout and made it easier to group everything together making us visually see how each page of the BMX HotSpot website would look when made. One of the fundamentals of the website is the heading on each page of the site as it visually makes it clear to visitors what site they are on. For example, a scenario in which this can occur is when they leave the tab of BMX HotSpot and they're on another page of the site that does not contain the heading and come back after a while they would most likely forget what website they are on and close the tab fully decreasing engagement and traffic. Overall from the Wireframe presented you are able to identify how it has a basic navigation system such as About us, FQA, and a map an important feature as it's primarily the main feature that's going to be used by all visitors of the website. One of the main features that are represented on each page is laid out in a way that is straightforward, clean manner, this allows visitors to easily understand the site's structure and navigation paths. The simplicity of the layout helps more on focusing on usability and the flow. The wireframe also uses alternative text and simple boxes to indicate where actual content and interactive elements will be placed on the website, which is a typical approach in wireframing to maintain focus on layout and functionality.

REVIEW PAGE: We collectively agreed together that a review page will be needed as it'll help build trust and credibility with new visitors on the site. The review page will also allow us to showcase a variety of opinions and experiences that other riders have been through allowing others  making riders feel more confident in their decisions. Feedback from reviews will also provide valuable point of views into what riders like or dislike about the BMX facilities in Bristol. These feedbacks could also encourage facilities to improve on what needs to be improved it also makes it easier as the local council does not need to waste money on surveying on whats needed to be improved. 


FQA: </b>We decided on adding man FQA page as It helps reduce the amount of workload for the customer support by supplying immediate answers to common questions thatâ€™ll most likely be asked allowing to focus more on important issues such as data breaches. It overall improves the overall user experience as well by making it easy for visitors of BMX-Finder to find quick solutions, reducing frustration and saving time.</b>

ABOUT US: Having an about us page will provide opportunities to introduce the people to the purpose of BMX-Finder. The about us page will most likely include the following the inspiration for what we do, the backstory, mission, core value and insight to the team. About us page also will help us distinguish from other sites by highlighting our unique aspects .
