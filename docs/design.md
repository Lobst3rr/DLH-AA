## User Interface design

when it comes to wireframes we know them as a visual representation of what a website layout would look like. Looking at 
wireframes it is used to focus more on arrangements such as functionality rather than aesthetics and looks as it is the 
blueprint for building, outlining the form and the relation between different parts of the website without the whole detailed 
graphic parts (CSS). Wireframes are crucial as they help identify potential issues that could occur early in the development process. Discovering potential issues is highly important as it allows us to stay on track and get the website done on time 

BMX FINDER wireframe:
--
When constructing the wireframe we opted to use whimsical tool as it has an easy layout and made it easier to group everything together making us visually see how each page of the BMX finder website would look when made. As you can see we highlighted one of the fundamentals of the website which is the heading on each page to make it visually clear to visitors what site they are on. For example, a scenario in which this can occur is when they leave the site on another page instead of the home screen and come back after a while they would most likely forget what website they are on and close the tab fully. All together from the Wireframe you are able to identify how it has a basic navigation system such as About us, FQA, and a map an important feature as it's primarily the main feature that's going to be used by all visitors of the website. One of the main features that are represented on each page are laid out in a way that is straightforward, clean manner, this allows visitors to easily understand the site's structure and navigation paths. The simplicity of the layout helps more on focusing on usability and the flow. The wireframe also uses alternative text and simple boxes to indicate where actual content and interactive elements will be placed on the website, which is a typical approach in wireframing to maintain focus on layout and functionality.
